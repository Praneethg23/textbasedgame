I spent hardly 5 hours in developing and more 6 hours to satisfy autograder(for print statements)
I tested it manually gave variety set of inputs and used different maps for it.
No bugs as of gameplay but yes there exists some bugs with printing things
I tried different types of printing sequences to resolve the mismatch in printing
